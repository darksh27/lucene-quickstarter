Quickstarter for DBpedia Spotlight Lucene
===================

You can use this repository for creating lucene backend index of DBpedia Spotlight in your language.

The repo is ready to use for the follow languages: arabic  czech, german , greek , english, spanish, french , italian, korean , dutch, polish, portuguese, hungarian and russian.

### Why my language is not supported yet?
===================
We are working on i18n support and you can help us on it. You just need update or create the stop words list and a black listed URI pattern (a small regex for disambiguation pages) for your target language. You can follow a lot of examples at /i18n folder.

### Requirements
===================
To create a new  index you will require

* Linux;
* A good computer with enough memory (16 gb or more);
* Maven;
* Java 1.7;
 

### How to run
===================
 * Clone this repo locally;
 * Download the latest dump of Wikipedia. You can use the command line
 
  `./lucene-quickstarter/scripts/download_wikipedia.sh LANGUAGE_CODE`
  
   E.g: `./lucene-quickstarter/scripts/download_wikipedia.sh en`  for english

 * Download the DBpedia dumps, just typing 
 
 `./lucene-quickstarter/scripts/download_dbpedia.sh.sh VERSION LANGUAGE_CODE`
 
   E.g: `./lucene-quickstarter/scripts/download_dbpedia.sh 3.9 en `for english

  Check if all files were successfully downloaded. From DBpedia, we must have all files (labels, disambiguations, redirects, short_abstracts, article_categories and instance_types). If some file is not available, ask for help in DBpedia mail list.
  
  Finally
  
  * Run the indexer script
  
  `.lucene-quickstarter/scripts/run_index.sh VERSION LANGUAGE_CODE`

If you are here, seems that you have a new index ready for use. If not, tell us opening an issue.

Supported Extraction Framework versions
===================
All the scripts supports Extraction Framework 3.9. We found that new versions have a new folder structure (with slightly modification). 

Hey, Don't be sad!  In a few days we will have done for the new releases.
